## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- virtualenv (recommended)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-rag-system.git
cd financial-rag-system

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Pinecone (required)
# 1. Sign up at pinecone.io
# 2. Create a new index
# 3. Add your API key to .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

### Pinecone Configuration
Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
```toml
PINECONE_API_KEY = "your_pinecone_api_key"
PINECONE_ENV = "your_pinecone_environment"
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

```bash
# Start the Streamlit application
streamlit run app.py
```
